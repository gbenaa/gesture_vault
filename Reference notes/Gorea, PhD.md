## three modes of artistic vision

“three underlying modes of artistic vision that expose the metaphysical issues of representation within today’s spectacle of technological screens: 1) a symbolic (Platonic) seeing of the invisible as totally absent from the visible, 2) a realistic (Nietzschean) seeing that claims the invisible as really present in the space defined by a viewer’s perspectival gaze, and 3) a symbolic-realistic (Byzantine) vision of evoking the presence of an absent, invisible image through a tangible creative experience” ([Gorea, pp. -](zotero://select/library/items/X8HMF29A)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=3&annotation=8JEPLYG5)) ^8c2776
