From Fayum portraits to Byzantine icons

  

While the evidence is very fragmentary, we can glimpse the transition from pagan to Christian art in the Roman world. Fayum portraits and the first Christian icons must have existed side-by-side until the final extinction of portrait mummies. Icons dating from the 6th-7th century preserved in St Catherine's monastery, Mount Sinai, bear a striking resemblance to the portraits [28]. Their place of origin is debated, but unquestionably Egyptian are 6th-century Christian wall-paintings such as those from Bawit, south of Hermoupolis, and a number of 4th-7th-century icons [e.g. 33]. Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, humidity and iconoclasm have taken their toll; but there can be no doubt that portraits like those found in the Fayum are the forebears of icons. 33

  

It must have been relatively easy for the early Christians in Roman Egypt to switch from the worship of painted portraits of gods and emperors and of men and women to the worship of painted portraits of divine personages (i.e. Christ or the Virgin Mary) and of saints and martyrs. The new icons were a way of bringing religion into the home, particularly at the time when public worship was forbidden.

  

A plausible argument explaining the transition from the Fayum portraits to early Christian icons34 suggests that, during the persecution of Christians in Egypt, the bodies of martyrs were embalmed (or what fragments could be gathered were conserved) and placed in shrines where their life and suffering were commemorated on the anniversary of their deaths; if a painted portrait was incorporated into the mummy, then the Christian faithful would have been worshipping a portrait mummy. When the existence of the martyrium was suspected by the authorities, the Christians would have fled, taking with them what was most easily transportable, namely the portrait - and this portrait, the eikon, would then become the surrogate for the mummified body they had had to leave behind.

  

The value that the Greek tradition placed on realism and truth in portraiture was significant in the early Church's attitude to images. The first literary evidence of a Christian portrait appears in the apocryphal Acts of the Apostle John, a 2nd-century text from Asia Minor. 35 Lycomedes, a disciple, had a portrait of the apostle painted secretly, took it to his room and decorated it with flowers. John became curious and eventually he was shown the portrait of an old man, adorned with flower garlands, standing on an altar with candles in front of it. 36 John was perplexed and asked Lycomedes who the individual was whom he was worshipping in this pagan fashion. On being told that the image was of himself, John demanded proof and was brought a mirror (for he had never seen himself before): he appreciated the painter's effort, but as a good Christian

disapproved of the portrait as being 'childish and imperfect a dead likeness of the dead'. To Eusebius at the beginning of the 4th century, an icon of Christ was meaningless because it was impossible to depict His divinity. To Epiphanius of Salamis at the end of the same century, icons were immoral and should be destroyed because they were lies. The painters had not seen Christ or St Peter, for instance; they gave Christ long hair only because he was a Nazarene and that was the fashion in Nazareth, and when it came to St Peter, they did not know whether the apostle was really bald or how his beard was cut. 37 Finally, in 787, the Seventh Council of Nicaea ended with a theoretical victory for the iconophiles:38 it ruled that since Christ was the son of God born in human form, he might be painted as such. What was not acceptable was to represent him as Zeus, as had been done.

  

The Fayum portraits and Christian icons have specific features in common, notably the technique in which they are painted and their expressive eyes. The clearest evidence for a direct continuity lies in their common technique. The Greek painter Yannis Tsarouchis devoted much of his life to learning how ancient painting was done. His own training (in the late 1920s in Athens, by Fotis Kondoglou, the revivalist of the Byzantine technique) and copies he made in the course of his career of several of the Fayum portraits taught him that many of the secrets of the ancient painting techniques had been preserved in Byzantine icon-painting. In the next chapter we will look at methods and materials in more detail, and will see that terminology still used today in traditional Greek icon-painting can be applied directly to the Fayum portraits.

  

The entire tempera technique later used in Byzantine icons can be found in its original form in the mummy portraits painted in tempera. Striking examples of this are the portraits of 'Zenobia' [1], and 'Aline' [51], the latter on a dark ground and therefore more like a Byzantine icon. Encaustic, a wax-based painting medium, is also used in both genres. Also in both, a basic palette of four colours -white, yellow ochre, red and black - is used for flesh areas. And in both, with the exception of tempera portraits on a white ground such as 'Zenobia', the painter works from dark to light, from a toned ground (the khaki proplasmos under flesh areas) up to highlights. While the mummy portraits may or may not have highlights in the eyes, however, icons never do.

  

Another link is the presence of gilding. Several of the Fayum portraits have gold backgrounds [e.g. 60, 87, 113]. The followers of Carpocrates in Alexandria worshipped portraits of pagan philosophers and of Jesus and St Paul that were, we are told, 'painted in various colours, even gold and silver', 39 A papyrus from Oxyrhynchus, dating from the 7th or 8th century, refers to 'two small icons of St Colluthus and the Theotokos [the Mother of God], partly and wholly gilded'.4° A further resemblance is that between an icon covered in silver, leaving only the face and hands of the holy person visible, and a portrait showing through the wrappings or case, like the 'Golden Girl' [60]. The striking similarity between the two types of artefact cannot be purely coincidental.

  

Byzantine icon-painters inherited more than the secrets of technique from their pagan predecessors. Their habit of fasting during periods of artistic creativity was originally practised, according to Pliny, by Protogenes in the 4th century BC: 'It is said that while painting this [his lalysus] he lived on soaked lupins, because he thus at the same time both sustained his hunger and thirst and avoided blunting his sensibilities by too luxurious a diet.'41

  

It is highly likely that the large spiritual eyes of icons had their origins in Egypt. While over-life-size eyes are also found in Greek and Roman art, where they are meant to express superior status, in Egyptian iconography eyes play a very important role, and the Fayum painters were surrounded by works of a three-thousand-year-old artistic tradition overemphasizing the eyes. Cartonnage mummies were still being made in Roman Egypt, and their producers adhered to the custom of painting in enormous eyes, heavily outlined in black [29]. To many of the painters, who had to compete, and indeed to many of their patrons, a realistic representation of eyes may well have seemed lifeless and understated. 42 The Greek artists had brought three-quarter and frontal poses to a country where all human figures had hitherto been depicted in profile. This gave the Fayum painters a range of possibilities, from frankly over-enlarged eyes to eyes that are more naturalistic but highly expressive.

  

People often comment that the eyes in the portraits are disproportionately large; while this is true for some it is by no means so for all. The many portraits that do have exceptionally large eyes are generally the more stylized, Eastern-influenced works, which are characterized not only by unnaturally large eyes but by full frontality and flat handling of paint [e.g. 74, 117]. Among the more sophisticated portraits there are only a few with this distortion. Two examples are 'The European' [86], and the wonderful El Greco-like man from Philadelphia [15], both of whom also have extraordinarily long necks. It is less the size of the eyes that makes the portraits so powerful and magnetic than their expression and the direction of their gaze, looking directly out at the spectator [e.g. 20]. The Egyptian tradition had taught the Fayum painters the importance of the eyes and sanctioned them to achieve the maximum expression in a minimum of space. The result is that through the frame of the mummy wrappings peers a face that is alive, its eyes laying bare the soul of the portrayed for eternity. Both chronologically and geographically, the power of the gaze of the Fayum portraits was inherited by the icons. Given that in the Christian faith the spirit is everything and the body a mere vehicle for the soul, the eyes, as 'windows of the soul', convey their subjects' spirituality.

  

It seems that throughout the 5th century the word eikon continued to be applied to a painted portrait, whether of a saint or a common mortal. In the 6th century a different word, graphis, appears in texts more frequently and signifies specifically a secular portrait. This suggests that the older eikon was now reserved for religious paintings only, its adoption a telling indication of the origins of Byzantine icons.
