# Manichaeism

Manichaeism is a dualistic religion founded by the prophet Mani in the 3rd century CE, teaching that the universe is a struggle between the forces of light (spirit) and darkness (matter). It blended elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism, and aimed to free the soulâ€™s divine light from the material world through knowledge and ascetic living.
